# Econometrics Cheat Sheet

Econometrics cheat sheet using LaTeX with a summarized review of the basic econometrics concepts, assumptions and properties of the linear regression model, OLS equations and interpretatations, error measures, r-squared, hypothesis testing with individual and F contrast, confidence intervals, dummy variables and structural change, predictions, and a revision of the most popular OLS problems: multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity and auto-correlation
